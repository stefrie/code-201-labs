## About Me, with a guessing game

This repo demonstrates a the basic structure of an HTML 5 web page, which references external CSS and JavaScript source files.

The script prompts the visitor to answer questions from the information about the page's author. The answers are derived from the about me page. Also, the script alerts the visitor about the correctness of their responses.

### Reflections and Comments
* This was a fun exercise
