## About Me, with a guessing game, adding 2 new questions with loops

The script prompts the visitor to answer questions from the information about the page's author. The answers are derived from the about me page. Also, the script alerts the visitor about the correctness of their responses.

Two questions were added to practice using JavaScript loops.
