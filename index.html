    <p>I'm Joe. I used to be a Sergeant in the US Marine Corps where I fought in <a
        href="https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/middle-east/operation-iraqi-freedom.html">Operation
        Iraqi Freedom</a> from 2005-2006 at the peak of insurgency and sectarian conflict; an intersting time in <a
        href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/timeline-the-rise-spread-and-fall-the-islamic-state">US Military
        history</a>.</p>
    <p>Immediately after graduating from <a href="https://www.cpp.edu">Cal State Poly University</a>, I
      found work as a Senior .NET Developer on a team of 3 engineers and helped
      create <a href="https://www.crmls.org">the largest and most recognized Multiple Listing Service in the United
        States</a> by architecting and developing <a
        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction">.NET Core</a> microservices to support an
      aggressive growth strategy.</p>
    <p>I resigned in July 2021 to pursue a specialized education in frontend development at <a
        href="https://www.codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a>, a Veteran-friendly tech academy.</p>
    <p>
    <ul>My goals as a software architect and engineer are to:
      <li>Start a small dev shop of my own</li>
      <li>Contribute to open source software</li>
      <li>Create a new business model that nobody has thought of yet</li>
    </ul>
